            alt="Valid CSS!" />
    </a>
  


  

Here you will also be able to read a input from a fellow student due to the Peerview. 
The feedback will be used to make adjustments and improve the site. New features will be added in the next step.

The things my classmate (Selected by teacher) will be looking at are:

* HTML logical, correctly indented and easy to read?
* CSS logical, correctly indented and easy to read?
* Clear nameing of classes, easy to understand what is beeing styled?
* Too much/unnessesary CSS? To many selectors or to specific selectors? Repeting?
* Interface (design) clearly devided and easy to use?
* Are there any changes that could be implemented to ease the usage of the site? Enhanced Contrast? Use more magin/padding? Are there elements that are unevanly centered etc.?
* Other Thoughts.

So Here´s my first attempt at the Arboreal -Assignment. 
Validated by W3C Validators HTML and CSS without any varnings or errors. On bottom of the site you can find the W3C Validated "stamp".
  Arboreal - Part 2.
  
  Feedback from fellow student:
  * HTML and CSS looks nice and well structured.
  
  Improvement ideas:
  NAVIGATION
  * Left side menu with shorter distans in between adding logo to the right side of Navigation.
  - I did´nt follw this advice, thou I think it was a good one. But I did attach the logo to the navigation bar, but on the left side.
 
 HEADER
  * What is the main focus? The picture or the companyname?
  - I to realized that the image was taking up to much of the attantion, so I workd on it in Photoshop by adding filters and layers of the background color to blend the image to the background. 
  - I also added some text-shadow to the header.
  
  TEXT-ALIGN
  * Suggestion left-aligned text as it is easier to read.
  - I did not implement that because I my self like centered text.
  
  TABLE
  * unnecessary hoover on the table-data.
  - True. It was´nt that pretty, but fun to play with. So yes, I took it away.
  
  BODY
  * To similar colors, make a confusing impression.
  - Well I remade all the colors, by working with collecting colors in photoshop from the main picture.
    Using gradiants to blend them in.
