Assignment to create a website for Arboreal.(HTML/CSS) with peerview.

Arboreal is a start up company with subscription service decorating/maintaining a green indoor enviroment for offices.
There are diffrent themes and different packages.

Assignment Containing:
- Multiple-column-layout.
- Semantic HTML, <div> solely in purpose to style.
- Styled with .class or <tag>. No inline styling in HTML.
- Mainly use flexbox for positioning , using float is also accepted.
- Majority use of relative measurements like % or em/rem. Use consistently. Margines and padding should not scattered px-values.(magic numbers.)
-Navigationbar linked to subpages. Single page application is optional, though navigation still need to be linked to the hearders.(scroll down to header.)
- The site should contain info about the company, logotype, slogan, pricing , themes and a contactform where the user can fill out name, phonenumber, email, companyname and send a message. The Inputfield should have the right type and be labeled.
- The project should have a README.md that describes the project.
- Adding JavaScript is allowed though no extra cred, due to the course is in HTML/CSS.
- Important - HTML and CSS - correctly indented.
- Validated by W3C HTLM Validator /W3C CSS Validator containing no varnings or errors.

Here you will also be able to read a input from a fellow student due to the Peerview. 
The feedback will be used to make adjustments and improve the site. New features will be added in the next step.

The things my classmate (Selected by teacher) will be looking at are:

* HTML logical, correctly indented and easy to read?
* CSS logical, correctly indented and easy to read?
* Clear nameing of classes, easy to understand what is beeing styled?
* Too much/unnessesary CSS? To many selectors or to specific selectors? Repeting?
* Interface (design) clearly devided and easy to use?
* Are there any changes that could be implemented to ease the usage of the site? Enhanced Contrast? Use more magin/padding? Are there elements that are unevanly centered etc.?
* Other Thoughts.

So HereÂ´s my first attempt at the Arboreal -Assignment. 
Validated by W3C Validators HTML and CSS without any varnings or errors. On bottom of the site you can find the W3C Validated "stamp".
